<description>You also have access to the &lt;color=#00ff00ff&gt;COMMENTER&lt;/color&gt; tool.
You can use it on white text to see if that code affects the bug.
Check the functions below using the &lt;color=#00ff00ff&gt;COMMENTER&lt;/color&gt; tool.
The error will remain if you comment out non-buggy code.
Use the BUGCATCHER tool to catch the bug when you find it.</description>
